We have a relational MySQL database with a schema (country-city, language per country). There's a frequent query for cities that is causing performance issues. We've come up with a solution – to offload all frequently queried data into Redis (an in-memory key-value storage).

My result:
Redis:	98 ms
MySQL:	148 ms
